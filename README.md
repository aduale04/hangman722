# Hangman Game in Python

A simple and interactive implementation of the classic word-guessing game Hangman, written in Python. This project provides a fun way to practice and understand basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and list handling.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: Each game randomly picks a word from a predefined list.
- **Guess Tracking**: Correctly guessed letters are displayed, alongside placeholders for yet-to-be-guessed letters.
- **Limited Guesses**: The player has a fixed number of lives, adding challenge to the game.
- **Repeated Letter Handling**: Accurately displays all occurrences of correctly guessed letters.

User-Friendly Interaction: Simple console-based interface for input and output.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
cd hangman-game

Running the Game
To play the game, run the script in your terminal:
python hangman.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to start guessing letters.

How to Play
The game starts by randomly selecting a word from a predefined list.
Type in a letter as your guess and press Enter.
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed;
otherwise, you lose one life.

Continue guessing letters until you either complete the word or run out of lives.
Customization
You can modify the word_list variable in the script to add or change words.
